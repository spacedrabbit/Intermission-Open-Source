# Intermission App

**Empowering Musicians' Wellness through Technology**

## Introduction

Hey there I'm Louis, a senior iOS engineer with 8+ years experience writing and releasing apps. I'm excited to share the story of the Intermission App â€“ a project that came to life through a collaboration between myself and [Turn the Spotlight](https://www.turnthespotlight.org/) Fellows, [Elena Urioste](https://www.elenaurioste.com/) and [Melissa White](https://melissawhiteviolin.com/). They co-founded [Intermission Sessions](https://www.intermissionsessions.com/) as a heartfelt endeavor to offer specialized yoga practices, providing a path for colleagues to better navigate the demands of their craft while fostering holistic well-being. 

Together, we wanted to take their transformative yoga practice beyond in-person classes. Over nine months, I put my heart and soul into crafting and releasing this app.

## Technical Leadership and Collaborative Innovation

Taking the helm as the principal developer, advisor and designer, I guided the Intermission App through every stage, from ideation to its eventual release. Aligned with the shared vision of Elena and Melissa, our collaborative efforts extended beyond coding. To cultivate collaboration and foster professional development, I brought on board two junior developers whom I had previously mentored as students in my time as a teacher at [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/). This not only added diverse perspectives to the project but also provided these talented junior devs with real-world industry experience, enhancing their portfolios for future employment. Together, over nine months, we navigated challenges, exchanged insights, and crafted a robust platform that surpassed expectations, resonating seamlessly with Elena and Melissa's mission of bringing holistic wellness to classical musicians globally.

## A Bittersweet Journey

Unfortunately, after three successful years on the App Store, our journey hit an unexpected roadblock. A copyright troll in Germany led to the app being taken down. However, the spirit of Intermission App lives on in this open-source repository, serving as a testament to our collaborative effort. It's a bittersweet reminder of the impact we made and the challenges we faced in bringing practical technology and wellness to classical musicians.

## Impact and Gratitude

The Intermission App empowered fellows Elena and Melissa, elevating yoga instruction for classical musicians worldwide. By providing accessible yoga videos, the app expanded the reach of yoga instructors, attracting a global audience. The app additionally facilitated growth in their student base, increased interest in their biannual yoga retreats, and showcased two exceptional musicians who also happen to be women of color. 

Special thanks to [Turn the Spotlight](https://www.turnthespotlight.org/) for introducing me to their fellows. It's a rare opportunity for an iOS developer to volunteer their skill set and even rarer when that volunteer work can make a significant social equity impact.
